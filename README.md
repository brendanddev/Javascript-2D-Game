# Javascript-SVG-Game-Assignment

This game is called 'DodgeBall', and uses JavaScript as the language behind the game. This game forces the user to dodge obstacles using the 'WASD' keys on the keyboard, or the mouse to dodge these obstacles. The user can interact with one of two items, to either grow, or shrink, increasing the users overall points. The other obstacle is the one the user should be avoiding, as making contact with this obstacle will end the game. Additionally, going beyond the bounds of the game screen will cause the game to end aswell, adding an extra challenge. The user can choose between two modes, "NORMAL", or "HARD". The normal difficulty will have a default speed, and the hard difficulty will increase the speed of the gameplay.

The items/objects in this game are made up of SVG Javascript elements as the games components.
